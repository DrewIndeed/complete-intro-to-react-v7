=== About App and Components ===
- It doesn't have to be called 'root', just a common practice.
- React library script: the interface of how to interact with React; all the methods (except one) 
will be via this library. It contains no way of rendering itself though; it's just the API.
- React DOM library script:  the rendering layer. Since we're rendering to the browser, we're using React DOM
- Our code script: must come after the other two
- React.createElement does: it makes an instance of a class. An analogy is that App as a class of 
components is like Honda has a line of cars called Civics. It's a whole line of cars with various different options and parameters. 
An instance of a Civic would be one individual car. It's a concrete instance of the Civic car line.
- Will encounter this warning: react.development.js:245 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
This will go away in build version
