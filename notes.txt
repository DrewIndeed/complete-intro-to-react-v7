=== About App and Components ===
- It doesn't have to be called 'root', just a common practice.
- React library script: the interface of how to interact with React; all the methods (except one) 
will be via this library. It contains no way of rendering itself though; it's just the API.
- React DOM library script:  the rendering layer. Since we're rendering to the browser, we're using React DOM
- Our code script: must come after the other two
- React.createElement does: it makes an instance of a class. An analogy is that App as a class of 
components is like Honda has a line of cars called Civics. It's a whole line of cars with various different options and parameters. 
An instance of a Civic would be one individual car. It's a concrete instance of the Civic car line.
- Will encounter this warning: react.development.js:245 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
This will go away in build version

- At this point, App is the parent of Pet, bc App is rendering Pet. So the data flows from App down to Pet via props.
So how the data flows up? It doesn't. But how does that help? When something happens to App, I know that Pet does not
do it bc Pet has no effect on App, so we can ignore the whole seciton of code -> Good for debugging.
