=== About App and Components ===
- It doesn't have to be called 'root', just a common practice.
- React library script: the interface of how to interact with React; all the methods (except one) 
will be via this library. It contains no way of rendering itself though; it's just the API.
- React DOM library script:  the rendering layer. Since we're rendering to the browser, we're using React DOM
- Our code script: must come after the other two
- React.createElement does: it makes an instance of a class. An analogy is that App as a class of 
components is like Honda has a line of cars called Civics. It's a whole line of cars with various different options and parameters. 
An instance of a Civic would be one individual car. It's a concrete instance of the Civic car line.
- Will encounter this warning: react.development.js:245 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
This will go away in build version

- At this point, App is the parent of Pet, bc App is rendering Pet. So the data flows from App down to Pet via props.
So how the data flows up? It doesn't. But how does that help? When something happens to App, I know that Pet does not
do it bc Pet has no effect on App, so we can ignore the whole seciton of code -> Good for debugging.

- To use prettier from terminal: npx prettier <filepath> --write
- Turn on: format on save, prettier required config
- Why enable prettier required config? It will only format the project with .prettierrc
- About the .bin directory in node_modules, it contains the binary reference to the actually folder of the package 
or the library. That is why when we write scrips in package.json, it understands which folder to use when
executing the command

- prettier does not at your code and tell you what is wrong, it will handle that for you. Eslint will look at your
code and tell you what is wrong with it.
- npm i -D eslint@8.8.0 eslint-config-prettier@8.3.0
- "eslint": "^8.8.0" -> notice the ^ -> it means that if there is 8.3.1, go grab it. If you remove it, npm will
grab the exact version that yoiu specify
- Have you ever had conflicts between pretrier and eslint? If happens, follow prettier. 
- After config of .eslintrc.json, npx eslint src/App.js. It will give tons of errors that do not follow eslint rules.
To see the errors got highlighted on VScode, download ESLint from Microsoft.
- About prettier --check, this is usually used in Github pages, to tell people that have not formatted the files using
Prettier, their build will be marked as failed. 
- To run, npm run lint -- --fix
